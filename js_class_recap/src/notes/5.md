**The Factory Method pattern** and the **Abstract Factory pattern** are both creational design patterns, but they have different intents and structures. Here's a comparison of the two patterns:

Factory Method Pattern:
- Intent: The Factory Method pattern provides an interface for creating objects, but it allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. It delegates the responsibility of object creation to subclasses.
- Structure: In the Factory Method pattern, there is an abstract Creator class that declares the factory method, and concrete Creator subclasses implement the factory method to create specific product objects.
- Usage: The Factory Method pattern is suitable when you want to provide a framework for creating objects, but the exact types of objects are determined by subclasses. It promotes loose coupling between the creator and the concrete products.

Abstract Factory Pattern:
- Intent: The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It encapsulates the creation of multiple related objects.
- Structure: In the Abstract Factory pattern, there is an abstract Factory class that declares a set of factory methods, each responsible for creating a specific type of product object. Concrete Factory subclasses implement the factory methods to create products belonging to a specific family.
- Usage: The Abstract Factory pattern is suitable when you need to create families of related objects. It provides a way to enforce consistency among products of different types, ensuring that they are designed to work together. It promotes the creation of objects with a common theme or purpose.

In summary, the Factory Method pattern focuses on delegating object creation to subclasses, allowing them to decide the specific class to instantiate. It is useful when you have a single type of product and want to provide a framework for creating different versions of that product.

On the other hand, the Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related objects. It is useful when you need to create multiple families of related objects or when you want to enforce consistency among products belonging to the same family.

**EXAMPLE**

Here's an example that demonstrates the Factory Method pattern and the Abstract Factory pattern using a scenario of creating different types of vehicles:

Factory Method Pattern Example:
```typescript
// Abstract Vehicle class
abstract class Vehicle {
  abstract drive(): void;
}

// Concrete Car class
class Car extends Vehicle {
  drive(): void {
    console.log("Driving a Car");
  }
}

// Concrete Motorcycle class
class Motorcycle extends Vehicle {
  drive(): void {
    console.log("Riding a Motorcycle");
  }
}

// Abstract Creator class
abstract class VehicleCreator {
  abstract createVehicle(): Vehicle;

  // Other common methods or operations

  // Factory Method
  startDriving(): void {
    const vehicle = this.createVehicle();
    vehicle.drive();
  }
}

// Concrete Creator subclass for Cars
class CarCreator extends VehicleCreator {
  createVehicle(): Vehicle {
    return new Car();
  }
}

// Concrete Creator subclass for Motorcycles
class MotorcycleCreator extends VehicleCreator {
  createVehicle(): Vehicle {
    return new Motorcycle();
  }
}

// Usage
const carCreator = new CarCreator();
carCreator.startDriving(); // Output: "Driving a Car"

const motorcycleCreator = new MotorcycleCreator();
motorcycleCreator.startDriving(); // Output: "Riding a Motorcycle"
```

In this example, the Factory Method pattern is used to create different types of vehicles. The `VehicleCreator` class is an abstract class that declares the factory method `createVehicle()`. The `CarCreator` and `MotorcycleCreator` classes are concrete subclasses that implement the factory method to create specific types of vehicles (`Car` and `Motorcycle`, respectively). The `startDriving()` method represents the common operation performed on the created vehicle.

Abstract Factory Pattern Example:
```typescript
// Abstract VehicleFactory class
abstract class VehicleFactory {
  abstract createCar(): Car;
  abstract createMotorcycle(): Motorcycle;
}

// Concrete Car class
class Car {
  drive(): void {
    console.log("Driving a Car");
  }
}

// Concrete Motorcycle class
class Motorcycle {
  ride(): void {
    console.log("Riding a Motorcycle");
  }
}

// Concrete VehicleFactory subclass for creating European vehicles
class EuropeanVehicleFactory extends VehicleFactory {
  createCar(): Car {
    return new Car();
  }

  createMotorcycle(): Motorcycle {
    return new Motorcycle();
  }
}

// Concrete VehicleFactory subclass for creating American vehicles
class AmericanVehicleFactory extends VehicleFactory {
  createCar(): Car {
    return new Car();
  }

  createMotorcycle(): Motorcycle {
    return new Motorcycle();
  }
}

// Usage
const europeanFactory = new EuropeanVehicleFactory();
const europeanCar = europeanFactory.createCar();
const europeanMotorcycle = europeanFactory.createMotorcycle();
europeanCar.drive(); // Output: "Driving a Car"
europeanMotorcycle.ride(); // Output: "Riding a Motorcycle"

const americanFactory = new AmericanVehicleFactory();
const americanCar = americanFactory.createCar();
const americanMotorcycle = americanFactory.createMotorcycle();
americanCar.drive(); // Output: "Driving a Car"
americanMotorcycle.ride(); // Output: "Riding a Motorcycle"
```

In this example, the Abstract Factory pattern is used to create families of related objects, specifically cars and motorcycles. The `VehicleFactory` class is an abstract class that declares factory methods for creating cars (`createCar()`) and motorcycles (`createMotorcycle()`). The `EuropeanVehicleFactory` and `AmericanVehicleFactory` classes are concrete subclasses that implement the factory methods to create specific types of cars and motorcycles.

The key difference between the two patterns is their focus. The Factory Method pattern delegates the responsibility of object creation to subclasses, allowing them to decide the specific class to instantiate. The Abstract Factory pattern encapsulates the creation of related objects without specifying their concrete classes, allowing the creation of families of objects.

I hope these examples help you understand the differences in code between the Factory Method pattern and the Abstract Factory pattern. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!
