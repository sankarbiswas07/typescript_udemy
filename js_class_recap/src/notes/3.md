Using a Factory class with a `create` method aligns with the SOLID principles, particularly the Open/Closed Principle and the Single Responsibility Principle.

1. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): The Factory pattern supports the OCP by allowing you to add new types (concrete classes) without modifying the existing code. When a new type needs to be created, you can simply create a new creator class that adheres to the Factory interface or extends the Factory class, making the code open for extension without the need to modify the existing code.

2. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): The Factory class takes on the responsibility of object creation, adhering to the SRP by having a single reason to change. It encapsulates the creation logic in a separate class, promoting separation of concerns and keeping the object creation code focused on its specific responsibility.

By using a Factory class instead of a switch case, you are promoting a more modular and maintainable codebase. It allows for better separation of concerns, easier extensibility, and improved code readability. It also helps in achieving loose coupling, as the Factory class acts as the entry point for object creation, enabling dependency injection and inversion of control.

Overall, using a Factory class with a `create` method is considered a best practice compared to using a switch case for object creation. It aligns with the SOLID principles and promotes clean, maintainable, and extensible code.

I'm glad the concept is clear to you now. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!
