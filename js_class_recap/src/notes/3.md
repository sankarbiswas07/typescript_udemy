Using a Factory class with a `create` method aligns with the SOLID principles, particularly the Open/Closed Principle and the Single Responsibility Principle.

1. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): The Factory pattern supports the OCP by allowing you to add new types (concrete classes) without modifying the existing code. When a new type needs to be created, you can simply create a new creator class that adheres to the Factory interface or extends the Factory class, making the code open for extension without the need to modify the existing code.

2. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): The Factory class takes on the responsibility of object creation, adhering to the SRP by having a single reason to change. It encapsulates the creation logic in a separate class, promoting separation of concerns and keeping the object creation code focused on its specific responsibility.

By using a Factory class instead of a switch case, you are promoting a more modular and maintainable codebase. It allows for better separation of concerns, easier extensibility, and improved code readability. It also helps in achieving loose coupling, as the Factory class acts as the entry point for object creation, enabling dependency injection and inversion of control.

Overall, using a Factory class with a `create` method is considered a best practice compared to using a switch case for object creation. It aligns with the SOLID principles and promotes clean, maintainable, and extensible code.

=============


1. Switch case: The switch case implementation is a common approach to implementing the creator method in the Factory Method pattern. It uses a switch statement to match the shape type and create the corresponding shape class. This approach is simple and widely used, but it can become cumbersome as the number of shape types increases.

2. Making a record: the shapeClasses property is a mapping object where the keys represent the shape types, and the values are functions that create instances of the corresponding shape classes.
This approach offers a concise and extensible solution by leveraging functions as values in the mapping object. It allows for flexibility in defining the creation logic for each shape type.

3. Exporting concrete factory class: In the Factory Method pattern, it's typical to have an abstract creator or factory class that defines the factory method (e.g., createShape()) as an abstract method. Concrete creator classes, derived from the abstract creator, implement the factory method to create specific instances of the shape classes. The factory classes are not usually exported directly; instead, they are used internally within the application to create objects.

To summarize, the Factory Method pattern commonly employs switch case statements or mapping objects for the creator method implementation. Exporting concrete factory classes is not a typical practice, as the focus is on encapsulating object creation logic within the factory classes and providing an abstract interface for creating objects.
